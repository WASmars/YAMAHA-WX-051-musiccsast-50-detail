due to sudden no audio after long perios of unplugged status, there has some deep dive to the hardware try to figure it out. but somehow it restored after some power socket reinstall, or wifi board reinstall. currently no idea on it


the idea is to figure out the reason of sudden no audio after boot from long period unplugged status.
I disassembled it since it is oversea purchase, there has no warranty from distributor or original maker.

- find the reason of no audio
-- no  clew, sometimes it restore after re-plug the power cord in the speaker
--

- try to make the optical port work in the China version, there has only coaxial for digital input in this version.
-- the OPamp for toslink is removed, not yet trace down the route of coaxial signal. from the basis the digital format should be similar
